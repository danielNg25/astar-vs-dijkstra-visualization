# Path Finding

## Description
This program provides a visual demonstration of the process undergone by  A* (A star)

## A*
A* works similarly to dijkstra by creating a priority queue of nodes and then adding new nodes to the queue by exploring the top node on the queue. However in A* the nodes are placed into the queue with a heuristic of distance to the finish node. This means that the node at the top of the queue is always the node closest to the finish node.
